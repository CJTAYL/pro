# Delinquency Report 

The delinquency report is used by the Chief Lending Officer and Cheif Risk Officer to review the financial health of the institution. The report summarizes the data with the modified delinquency ratio (MDR), which is calculated with the following formula: 

$$ \frac{\Sigma \text{ current balance of delinquent loans}}{\Sigma \text{ current balance of all loans}} $$

For example, if a portfolio was comprised of Loan A (current balance of $100), Loan B (current balance of $200), and Loan C (current balance of $300, and Loan A was delinquent, the MDR would be 0.167.

$$ \frac{100}{100 + 200 + 300} = \frac{100}{600} = 0.167 $$
