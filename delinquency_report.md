# Delinquency Report 

The delinquency report is used by the Chief Lending Officer and Cheif Risk Officer to review the financial health of the institution. The report summarizes the data with the modified delinquency ratio, which is calculated with the following formula: 

$$ \frac{\Sigma \text{ current balance of delinquent loans}}{\Sigma \text{ current balance of all loans}} $$
