# Delinquency Report 

The delinquency report is used by the Chief Lending Officer and Cheif Risk Officer to review the financial health of the institution. The report uses the modified delinquency ratio (MDR), which is calculated with the following formula: 

$ \frac{\Sigma number of delinquent loans}{\Sigma total number of loans} $
